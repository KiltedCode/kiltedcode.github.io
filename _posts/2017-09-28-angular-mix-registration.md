Conferences are great places to learn new technologies, network with your peers, and even make some friends. For me, they are also a great place to _share_ my knowledge, when I'm given the opportunity. There is a great conference coming up in October that I'm very excited to be selected to speak at: [AngularMix](https://angularmix.com/).

AngularMix with be held at [Loew's Royal Pacific Resort](https://angularmix.com/#!/travel), Orlando, Florida. The [conference sessions](https://angularmix.com/#!/sessions) are October 10 - 12, 2017 with [workshops](https://angularmix.com/#!/workshops) before and after on October 8, 9, & 13.

I'll turn it over to their description:

> The AngularMix conference is all about igniting conversations around Angular and enterprise technologies that make modern browsers shine. Learn directly from the Angular team as well as Angular experts from around the world about an incredibly vast array of topics. If you work with Angular in the enterprise then you need to be at AngularMix! AngularMix is more than just sessions, it's also about networking and having a great time with experts and peers between sessions, at lunch and at evening receptions and activities. Remember what they say, "All work and no play makes Jack..." You'll have plenty of time to enjoy Universal Studios right next door!
> 
> AngularMix brings the latest and greatest on progressive web apps and mobility, JavaScript/TypeScript, the Angular CLI, RxJS, AI, IoT, building for production with AOT, visualizing data and much more. And if that isn't enough we'll also bring you the scoop on Server-side technologies such as NodeJS, ASP.NET Core as well as security, performance, DevOps and much more!

Now, what excites me about this conference?
- It is an **excellent** looking Angular centric conference here on the east coast.
- **HUGE** name speakers: MiÅ¡ko Hevery, Igor Minar, Jules Kremer, Stephen Fluin, Brad Green, John Papa, Dan Wahlin.
- A wealth of speakers across the industry offering unique viewpoints (like me).
- Three days of conference and three days of workshops
- Conference at Universal Studios _AND_ a private Harry Potter party in the parks!

I'd like to elaborate a little on something I'm excited for: the Harry Potter private party. Sure, they could have a happy hour, but that's for muggles. Instead, the team of Angular mix is throwing a private party in the parks featuring The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

> As an attendee of AngularMix you are invited to an exclusive event at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park - The Wizarding World of Harry Potter!  After a full and exciting day of AngularMix you will be transferred directly to a PRIVATE party right in the middle of this world class entertainment experience.  No lines here, you're a VIP!  We'll have Harry Potter's magical world completely to ourselves!  You'll walk down the corridors of Hogwart's Castle and right on to one of the most advanced and THRILLING theme park experiences ever - 'Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey!'  Sample Butter Beer, ride the Hogwart's Express and get lost in the incredibly magical world of Hogsmeade.

You read that right: no lines (just the conference attendees), buffet style food service, Butter Beer, and entertainment including the Frog Choir and Triwizard Spirit Rally. Even if you're not a Harry Potter fan, it's still food and drinks and rides. Just some sweet icing on the conference cake.
