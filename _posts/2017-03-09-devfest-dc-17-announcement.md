I am super excited to announce I will be speaking again this year at [DevFest DC (May 5 - 6)](http://www.devfestdc.org/). This is one of my favorite conferences to attend and speak at. It is a fantastic conference that started several year ago as one of many Google Developer Groups (GDG) held DevFests all on the same day. The then small conference has now grown into a fantastic two day conference with some amazing speakers and workshops at an amazing price. The conference every year always been great for Android, Web and Cloud technologies sessions (as it is put on by the GDG). This year will be the first spring offering of DevFest DC and will also be bringing Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, IoT and Deep Learning to the lineup. 

The full schedule is still being worked out, but the [speakers page](http://www.devfestdc.org/speakers/) is slowly starting to fill out with the speakers, as we get our details back to the DevFest team. The current early bird rate available through March 15th is just $50, which is amazing considering the multi-day, multi-track + workshops all included with breakfast, lunch, snacks, and last year a Friday happy hour. For all the details or to register check out [DevFestDC.org](http://www.devfestdc.org/).

As I noted with my excitement, I'll be [speaking](http://www.devfestdc.org/speakers/john-niedzwiecki/) at this DevFest DC. My session is title [Myths of Angular 2: What Angular Really Is](http://www.devfestdc.org/sessions/myths-of-angular-2-what-angular-really-is/). This is meant to be an introductory session about Angular and to set the record straight about #justangular. Following the announcement of Angular 2, many people were unhappy with the drastic changes. Between the announcement and release, many things about Angular have changed. Unfortunately, many people still hang onto the impression they got from that announcement instead of what was actually done. I'll present the basic of Angular, bust some of those myths people think are true, talk through the inevitable question about the version numbers, and give a look at "why Angular".

If you're in there area, I highly suggest attending (both DevFest DC and my session). If you do, be sure to come say hi. This conference has a *very* high value for your money. If not, you can be sure to see more about my talk on here. I hope to see you there!
